* Install
When released on MELPA, this package can be installed with =package-install=
or a =use-package= block.

In order for it to work, you must have the GNU =plotutils= package installed
on your system and in your path.  It contains the =pic2plot= program on which
this package depends.

** For Ubuntu

#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt install plotutils
#+end_src

** For Arch

#+begin_src sh
  sudo pacman -Sy plotutils
#+end_src

* Usage
** Source Blocks
This package allows a source block to use the =pic= language designator on a
source block:

#+header: :file output.png
#+begin_src pic
down;
box "Emacs"; arrow;box "OrgMode"; arrow
box "begin_src" "pic"; arrow; box "ob-pic"; arrow;
box "pic2plot"; arrow; box "output.png"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:output.png]]

The block requires a =:file= argument (except with the -T X output format).
By default, it outputs a =png= file, but this can be adjusted by providing a
=:cmdline= argument with the value =-T <type>=, where =<type>= is one of the
types supported by =pic2plot=:

- =X= :: the X Window System (no :file argument needed)
- =png= :: PNG format
- =pnm= :: portable anymap (PBM/PGM/PPM) format
- =gif= :: pseudo-GIF format
- =svg= :: the XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics format
- =ai= :: the format used by Adobe Illustrator
- =ps= :: `idraw'-editable Postscript
- =cgm= :: the WebCGM format for Web-based vector graphics
- =fig= :: the format used by the `xfig' drawing editor
- =pcl= :: the Hewlett-Packard PCL 5 printer language
- =hpgl= :: Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language (by default, HP-GL/2)
- =regis= :: the ReGIS (remote graphics instruction set) format developed by
  DEC
- =tek= :: Tektronix format
- =meta= :: device-independent GNU graphics metafile format

With the =-T X= argument, an X window containing the graphic will pop up.

In actual pic code, each picture must be started with a ".PS" directive and
ended with ".PE".  =ob-pic= adds those delimiters automatically.

** The =pic= Language
As for the =pic= language, perhaps the best source is Brian Kernighan's
original Bell Labs Computing Science Technical Report No. 116 on the language
from 1991, which can be found [[https://pikchr.org/home/uv/pic.pdf][here]].  There is even an earlier paper from [[https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/872730.806459][1981]].

Eric S. Raymond also describes the GNU implementation of the language,
called =gpic= in [[https://pikchr.org/home/uv/gpic.pdf][this paper]].

In addition, Dwight Aplevitch has implemented a version of =pic= called
=dpic=, which is capable of outputing several additional formats, including
TikZ for LaTeX.  His documentation is also available [[https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~aplevich/dpic/dpic-doc.pdf][online]].

** The =pic2plot= Program
There is an [[info:plotutils#pic2plot Invocation][info node]] for this program if you have installed the =plotutils=
package, but it also has its documentation available [[https://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/manual/en/html_node/pic2plot-Invocation.html][here]].
